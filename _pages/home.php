<h1>Welcome to Cheezy</h1>

<p>Cheezy is a simple HTML templating "framework" using PHP.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Who is this for?</dt>
  <dd>For you, if you have content, a text editor, and you don't need controllers or object-relational mapping, and probably don't even know what that means.</dd>
  <dt>Why did you do this?</dt>
  <dd>You know how there are all sorts of "lightweight" frameworks but they don't ever really seem to be so lightweight or simple? Well, that's what I'm hoping this fixes.</dd>
  <dt>What does this require?</dt>
  <dd>Not much: PHP 5, Apache. If you need a web host, I currently use DreamHost. Sign up <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?146412">using this link</a> and they'll credit me for the referral.</dd>
  <dt>Who's using it?</dt>
  <dd>This site, for one. And my friend <a href="http://davidhoang.com">David Hoang</a>. <a href="/contact">Let me know</a>, if you're using it!</dd>
  <dt>Where can I download this?</dt>
  <dd>You can download the source of this sample site and the framework from <a href="http://github.com/sxtxixtxcxh/Cheezy-Sample-Site">github</a>.</dd>
